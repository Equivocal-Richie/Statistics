# Statistics 101

Hereâ€™s the roadmap to becoming a statistics guru for data science, broken down into the core pillars we'll explore:

**1. Descriptive Statistics:**

- **Simply Put:** This is about summarizing and describing the main features of a dataset. Think of it as taking a large pile of numbers and boiling them down into understandable summaries.
- **Why it's Crucial:** Before you can do anything fancy, you need to understand your data's basic characteristics. Where is the center? How spread out is it? Are there outliers? Descriptive statistics gives you the tools to answer these fundamental questions.
- **What You'll Gain:** You'll be able to effectively explore, summarize, and visualize your data, communicating its key features clearly to others (stakeholders, teammates). This is often the very first step in any data science project. You'll master concepts like mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, percentiles, and different types of data distributions.
- **Finally** we are going to implement this by working on a real-life project to internalize the concepts (Coming soon!!)


**2. Probability Statistics:**

- **Simply Put:** Probability is the language of uncertainty. It gives us a framework to quantify how likely an event is to occur.
- **Why it's Crucial:** Data science is all about dealing with uncertainty. Whether you're building a predictive model or trying to understand the likelihood of a certain outcome, probability is fundamental. It underpins statistical inference and machine learning algorithms.
- **What You'll Gain:** You'll understand the principles of chance and randomness. You'll be able to calculate probabilities, understand concepts like conditional probability (Bayes' theorem is a big one here!), and work with different probability distributions (like the normal distribution, binomial distribution, etc.), which are essential for modeling data.
